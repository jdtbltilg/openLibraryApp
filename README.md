Small Coding challenge. This should take no more than an hour.
For this project | would like you to create a simple website that allows users to search for books.

Create a website with Typescript, React and a UI library of your choice. Add an input box to the site that
allows the user to type in a book name. Then, call this API with the info the book name the user
entered.

https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=book+name+here

Build it with auto-search (eg. no search button), but only call the API a reasonable amount of times (eg.
not every time the user clicks a keyboard button).

The API will return a list of books.

For each book, display the following info:
- Book title
- Author(s) name
- Year book was first published
- ISBN number
- Number of pages.

Please create a typescript type for the results object. You can use https://quicktype.io/typescript. Add a
button to toggle sorting the books by relevance (which is how openlibrary returns the books) or by the
year the book was first published.

When you are done, host the site on any hosting platform and send me the URL and the code. Github
Pages works well and is free.

| am looking for correct functionality and good use of React & Typescript. Good website aesthetics
helps as well.
